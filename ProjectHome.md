# The Wanderer's Guide to Earth #


The Wanderer's Guide to Earth  is an attempt at a [Wikitravel](http://www.wikitravel.org/en) downloader and offline viewer to make it possible to download and then browse all the Wikitravel articles while off-line.

Ideal for traveling where no Internet is available, between Internet spots or where Internet is expensive.

A free, up-to-date guidebook that can be updated by the user as Wikitravel changes.




Aimed at netbooks, laptops or pocketpcs. Could potentially work on Android due to it being written in Java. If you know how to port Java SE to an an Android and are interested in doing so, lets talk on what we can do!




Currently WGTE is a beta version (Meaning that you may encounter bugs while using this software as it is not completely finished yet. However it is still mostly functional).



Due to the lack of owning a Mac, WGTE has not been tested on Mac OSX. This doesn't mean it won't work :)






Future versions will focus on:

More efficient update process
Making the database more regional and modular
More powerful search function
Improving Hyperlinks between articles





If you have any ideas or features that you would like to see in WGTE, please let me know. I am interested to hear what you have to say.
